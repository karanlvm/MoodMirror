# MoodMirror

A project that was created for HackDay at The University of Texas at Arlington.

AI Mood Mirror is a Streamlit application designed to help you understand the intricate connection between your mental and physical well-being.

This project is a mental health companion but unlike most regular mental health comapanion, MoodMirror integrates user-uploaded health data to provide a holistic view of wellness. This innovative approach allows the AI, powered by the advanced Gemini API, to draw correlations between physical metrics and emotional experiences, offering deeper, more personalized insights.

The app doesn't just present data; it delivers actionable advice and practical steps, empowering users to proactively identify patterns and triggers, ultimately building a bridge to better self-understanding and well-being.

**Key Features:**

* **Holistic Well-being Integration:** Upload your health data (e.g., from a smartwatch or fitness tracker) and journal your daily experiences to gain a comprehensive view of your emotional and physical states.
* **AI-Powered Reflections:** Leverage the Gemini API to analyze your mood, journal entries, and health data, providing personalized reflections and insights.
* **Interactive Chatbot:** Engage in conversations with an AI therapist, using your stored data as context for personalized responses.
* **Gen-Z Mode:** An optional mode that uses casual, trendy language and Gen-Z slang, making the app relatable to a younger audience.
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Visualize your health and mood trends to identify patterns and triggers.
* **Journal History:** Track your emotional journey over time.
